Experimenting with bluetooth using python 3

At first I tried to use pybluez but then I decided to switch to using bluez + dbus. The scripts for pybluez are in a separate directory.

## Dependecies
- bluez

## Target platforms
- ~mac os 11.6~ it seems that I cannot install bluez on mac directly :(
- raspberry pi 4
